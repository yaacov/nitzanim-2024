# Nitzanim 2024 AI Demo Scripts

This repository contains demo scripts used in the Nitzanim 2024 AI talk. The scripts demonstrate various AI model techniques, including embeddings, transformers, and neural network architectures.

## Repository Contents

### Large Models
- [embedings.py](embedings.py): Demonstrates large model embeddings and calculates cosine distances.
- [transformer.py](transformer.py): Showcases the functionality of a large model transformer.

**Large Models** are typically used for tasks requiring high capacity and complexity, such as natural language processing, image recognition, and other applications where understanding nuanced patterns and relationships in large datasets is crucial.

### Small Models
- [one-node-user-weights.py](one-node-user-weights.py): Demonstrates a simple one-node neural network (perceptron).
- [three-node-user-weights.py](three-node-user-weights.py): Illustrates a three-node neural network model.
- three-node-train-weights.py](three-node-train-weights.py): Includes training logic for a three-node neural network.

**Small Models** are useful for simpler tasks or when computational resources are limited. They are often employed in scenarios where interpretability and efficiency are prioritized over the complexity and capacity of the model.
